===============
#####This is a collection of [ipython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and some results for analyzing aging rates in the [SardiNIA](https://sardinia.irp.nia.nih.gov/) project

You will need to install ipython notebook to use these interactively:

    pip3 install "ipython[notebook]"

Once you have ipython notebook installed, you can launch these notebooks from the top-level directory with the command:

    ipython3 notebook --ipython-dir=./ipython/ --profile=default

You can also view these notebooks statically using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/):
